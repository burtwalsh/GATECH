https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_function

Cummulative Distribution Function at x is the probability that the X (random variable) will take on a value less than x.

F(X,x) = Pr(X<= x)

Quantile Function --inverse of the CDF-- determines (gives) x assuming p

F(X,x) = Pr(X<=x)=p
Q(p) = inf(x such that p<=F(X,x))


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)

The power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis (H0) when a specific alternative hypothesis (H1) is true. The statistical power ranges from 0 to 1, and as statistical power increases, the probability of making a type II error (wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis) decreases.

Assuming mu=0 for H_0
Power given the alternative is true that we reject H_0
B(theta)=Pr(T_n>1.64|mu=theta)
